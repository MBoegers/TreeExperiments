## Idea

In this repository I try to implement [Binary Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) with usual Java.
As contrast, I also provide an implementation using Project Amber new Language Features.

## Prview Java inside!

To build and run you need a JDK 19 preview and enable preview features.
